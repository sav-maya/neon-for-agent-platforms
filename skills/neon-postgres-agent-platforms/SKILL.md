# Neon AI Agent Program (companion skill)

Companion to `**neon-postgres**` (install that first). This skill covers
fleet-scale control plane for the Neon Agent Program: dual-org layout, project
transfer, per-tenant provisioning, compound checkpoints, consumption, and
commercial terms.

For connection strings, drivers, ORMs, branching tutorials, Auth in apps, Data
API, and MCP, use `**neon-postgres**` and [Neon docs](https://neon.com/docs).

## Scope

Use `**neon-postgres**` for general Neon usage. Use **this skill** when the
question involves:

- Dual-org economics and API keys
- Project-per-tenant provisioning and transfer
- Fleet-wide snapshot/restore orchestration and housekeeping
- Compound checkpoints
- Consumption polling for metered fleets
- Agent Plan commercial terms (with links, not invented numbers)
- Partner support paths

## Install (order matters)

**Step 1:** Install the primary Neon skill from
[neondatabase/agent-skills](https://github.com/neondatabase/agent-skills):

```bash
npx skills add neondatabase/agent-skills -s neon-postgres
```

**Step 2:** Install this companion skill for Agent Program context:

```bash
npx skills add neondatabase/agent-skills -s neon-postgres-agent-platforms
```

Teams not on the Agent Program may use Step 1 alone. Everyone else needs both.

## Assistants: what you can do after install

With `**neon-postgres**` and **this skill** loaded, you have enough context for
platform-level Neon work: dual-org layout, provisioning a project for a new
tenant, compound checkpoints, org-wide consumption polling, and
transfer/upgrade flows—without the user pasting long documentation.

**Where runnable examples live:** TypeScript samples run from `**scripts/`** at
the [repo root](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-for-agent-platforms/tree/main/scripts)
(`package.json`, `npm run …`). This skill’s `**references/**` directory
mirrors those files as **symlinks** beside markdown guides so you can read
source next to docs;
[MANAGEMENT_API_SAMPLES.md](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-for-agent-platforms/blob/main/skills/neon-postgres-agent-platforms/references/MANAGEMENT_API_SAMPLES.md)
is the script catalog and env map. The human **Quick start** is the root
[README](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-for-agent-platforms/blob/main/README.md#quick-start).

## Gotchas

Non-obvious facts agents often get wrong:

- **Checkpoints are compound records.** A tenant checkpoint includes source
revision + Neon snapshot/branch + secrets/env version + deploy URL + agent
metadata. Do not equate "checkpoint" with "Neon branch" alone. See the
[compound checkpoints doc](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-for-agent-platforms/blob/main/skills/neon-postgres-agent-platforms/references/COMPOUND_CHECKPOINTS_FOR_AGENT_PLATFORMS.md).
- **Cross-org transfer** needs a **personal** API key (org keys only work
inside one org).
- **After a finalized snapshot restore**, the active branch ID changes. Poll
operations to completion before reconnecting. Delete orphaned `(old)` branches
to avoid storage cost.
- **Billing-aligned usage:** prefer
`GET /api/v2/consumption_history/v2/projects` over legacy consumption
endpoints.
- **Snapshot schedules** are not provided on Agent Plan. Partners implement via
snapshot API + their own scheduler.
- **Rates and caps:** never invent dollar amounts or limits. Confirm on live
neon.com docs.

## Agent Plan and two organizations

Partners run **two Neon organizations**:


| Org                    | Role                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Sponsored free org** | Free-tier end users (within program rules) |
| **Paid org**           | Paying customers (metered per Agent Plan)  |


Key points:

- Dollar rates, credits, and project caps come only from the live
[Agent Plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/agent-plan) and
[neon.com/agents](https://neon.com/agents). Do not invent numbers.
- **Organization API key:** automation inside one org (create project, set
quotas).
- **Personal API key:** required to transfer a project between orgs when a
customer changes tier, then PATCH quotas to match the new tier.

## HIPAA

- **Agent Plan includes HIPAA** with no extra fee. Partners must still follow
Neon's published HIPAA program (workflows, agreements, configuration).
- To get access or start the process, reach out to your **primary Neon
contact**.
- This skill is not legal advice.

Link: [HIPAA on Neon](https://neon.com/docs/security/hipaa)

## Fleet shape: project-per-tenant

- Neon's documented pattern is **one project per tenant app**. Isolation and
quotas align with Agent Plan metering.
- Sharing one project across tenants is an exception with higher complexity
(RLS, migrations, fairness).

[AI Agent integration guide](https://neon.com/docs/guides/ai-agent-integration)

## Snapshots and database versioning

For snapshot semantics, active-branch patterns, and restore tutorials, defer to
`**neon-postgres`** and
[AI database versioning](https://neon.com/docs/ai/ai-database-versioning).
Here, emphasize tenant fleets:

- Persist snapshot and branch IDs per tenant in your ledger. Tie each to
non-Neon state via
[compound checkpoints](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-for-agent-platforms/blob/main/skills/neon-postgres-agent-platforms/references/COMPOUND_CHECKPOINTS_FOR_AGENT_PLATFORMS.md).
- After finalized restores, branch IDs change and orphaned `(old)` branches
accumulate. Automate cleanup and update stored IDs.
- Poll operations to completion before reconnecting tenant apps.
- Product semantics (snapshot counts per tier, Beta pricing dates) change.
Confirm on [Agent Plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/agent-plan) docs.

Typical platform-level checkpoint triggers:

- Before promoting generated schema changes for a tenant
- Start or end of an agent run that mutates a tenant's database
- Before destructive migrations or customer-visible restore actions

## Sandbox and preview databases

Use this when a partner needs per-tenant preview or sandbox databases for
generated apps. ("How do I create a branch?" for a single app goes to
`**neon-postgres**`.)

- Track `project_id` / `branch_id` per customer / agent run when spinning
previews via the Management API.
- Branch and storage counts scale with fleet size. Monitor caps and
garbage-collect idle previews.
- Short `suspend_timeout_seconds` on preview computes reduces cost.
- Pair branch/snapshot lifecycle with secrets rotation and deploy URLs via
compound checkpoints.

## Cost, consumption, and entitlements

- **Never invent** pricing, quotas, or limits. Confirm on
[Agent Plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/agent-plan) and
[consumption metrics](https://neon.com/docs/guides/consumption-metrics).
- Use `GET /api/v2/consumption_history/v2/projects` for billing-aligned fields.
Legacy endpoints differ.
- Poll consumption roughly every 15 minutes. Polling does not wake suspended
computes.
- Run `auth-users.ts meta` from
[scripts/](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-for-agent-platforms/tree/main/scripts)
for a routing map (Neon Auth REST vs Postgres roles vs consumption APIs).

## Organization and project limit increases

- Current defaults and ceilings are on
[Agent Plan](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/agent-plan) and
[AI Agent integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/ai-agent-integration).
Do not invent limits.
- For project increase requests, email
[agents@neon.tech](mailto:agents@neon.tech) with org ID(s), growth context,
and timeline. Also flag in shared Slack if available.

## Co-marketing

- Co-marketing is an included Agent Plan benefit.
- Available: joint blog posts, social promotion, hackathon sponsorship, case
studies, landing page features.
- Reach out via shared Slack or your Neon representative with context on what
you're building.
